**Logger** is a high-performance **PHP extension** designed to handle high-capacity logging efficiently and flexibly. It adheres to the PSR-3 Logger standards, ensuring compatibility with modern PHP logging practices and seamless integration with other libraries and frameworks.

### Key features include:

- **Standard Log Levels**: **DEBUG**, **INFO**, **NOTICE**, **WARNING**, **ERROR**, **CRITICAL**, **ALERT**, and **EMERGENCY**.
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Adjust log levels, handlers, and file paths at runtime for full control.
- **Multiple Handlers**: Supports writing logs to `files`, `syslogs`, or `custom destinations`.
- **Optimized Performance**: Leverages native C++ for **minimal overhead** and **maximum speed**.
- **Extensibility**: Designed for custom handlers and advanced workflows.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Includes mechanisms to handle file errors and system failures gracefully.

**Installation**:
```bash
# NOT AVAILABLE!
pecl install logger
```

With Logger, developers can implement structured, customizable logging without sacrificing speed or reliability. Whether for debugging, monitoring, or auditing, Logger provides the tools to keep your application running smoothly.
Includes runtime configuration, multiple handlers (e.g., file, syslog), and uses fault-tolerant mechanisms to handle errors gracefully.


Logger is a high-performance PHP extension for flexible logging without the overhead. Follows the PSR-3 logger standards, and supports the standardized levels like DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, and CRITICAL.
