# PHP-Logger-Extension
Logger is a high-performance PHP extension for flexible logging without the overhead. Follows the PSR-3 logger standards, and supports the standardized levels like DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, and CRITICAL. Includes runtime configuration, multiple handlers (e.g., file, syslog), and uses fault-tolerant mechanisms to handle errors gracefully.
